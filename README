This folder contains a library called xmalloc and several programs to test xmalloc. xmalloc helps prevent common memory issues by warning the programmer and exit out accordingly.

Test Programs:
prog-01: Tests to see if xmalloc and xfree work regularly.
prog-02: Tests for freeing int he middle of a memory chunk.
prog-03: Tests for double free.
prog-04: Tests for freeing of illegal memory address.
prog-05: Tests for memory leaks.

Make File:
all: Compiles all of the test programs and xmalloc.
%-gcc: Compiles a single test program. Requires a xmalloc object file.
xmalloc-gcc: Compiles the xmalloc library into an object file.
run-%-gcc: Runs a test file, where % is the number 01-05.
clean: Cleans all .o files.
